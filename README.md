# Deep Learning
Assignments for Deep Learning (IE/CS 398)

HW1: Implement and train a logistic regression model from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The logistic regression model should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. It should achieve 90-93% accuracy on the Test Set.

HW2: Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The neural network should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. It should achieve 96-98% accuracy on the Test Set.

HW3: Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). You should write your own code for convolutions (e.g., do not use SciPy's convolution function). The convolution network should have a single hidden layer with multiple channels. It should achieve at least 96% accuracy on the Test Set.

HW4: Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset. The convolution network should use (A) dropout, (B) trained with RMSprop or ADAM, and (C) data augmentation. 

HW5: Implement a deep residual neural network for CIFAR100.

HW6: Generative adversarial networks (GANs).

HW7: Natural Language Processing.
