# Deep Learning
Assignments for Deep Learning (IE/CS 398)

HW1: Implement and train a logistic regression model from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The logistic regression model should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. It should achieve 90-93% accuracy on the Test Set. For full credit, submit via Compass (1) the code and (2) a paragraph (in a PDF document) which states the Test Accuracy and briefly describes the implementation. Due Monday, January 28 at 5 PM.

HW2: Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The neural network should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. It should achieve 97-98% accuracy on the Test Set. For full credit, submit via Compass (1) the code and (2) a paragraph (in a PDF document) which states the Test Accuracy and briefly describes the implementation. Due Wednesday, February 6 at 5:00 PM.
